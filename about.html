            <h2>Who Am I</h2>
            <p>GS Flooring is my creation. I am a flooring enthusiast from Kidderminster and now based in Upton-upon-Severn. With a passion for quality craftsmanship and exceptional service, I founded GS Flooring to bring premium flooring solutions to the community.</p>
            
            <!-- Kidderminster Carpets Heritage -->
            <h3>Heritage</h3>
            <p>Kidderminster has a storied legacy as a world-renowned carpet manufacturing hub. This rich heritage of textile excellence and craftsmanship has deeply influenced my approach to flooring. Just as Kidderminster became famous for producing the finest carpets, I am committed to delivering that same level of quality, attention to detail, and pride in craftsmanship to every project I undertake.</p>

            <h3>About Gary Stephenson</h3>
            <p>I am not just a flooring expert; I am also a soul music lover and classic scooter enthusiast. I share an appreciation for the iconic Lambretta scooters, which represent the same values that drive my business: style, quality, and reliability. When I am not helping customers find the perfect flooring solution, you can usually find me enjoying live music or out on my scooter.</p>
